# Swift.cv

A curated collection of Swift Playground projects demonstrating my iOS development expertise for common job requirements.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repo aims to be a portfolio of demos showcasing common Swift programming concepts.

These are *standalone* swift playground to showcase core Swift/iOS development concepts.

Each project demonstrates specific iOS development skills that are frequently sought by employers.

---

## 📂 Portfolio

### ✅ Completed
- **FilterMapReduceSort** - Demonstrates functional programming techniques with complex relational data 
- **ProtocolExamples** - Showcases 4 practical implementations of protocols, from basic to advanced usage

---

### 📝 In Progress
- **Simple Swift Concurrency** - Demonstrations of GCD and modern async/await patterns

### 📝 Planned
- **CoreDataCompany** - Core Data modelling and query implementation with relationship handling
- Memory Management and ARC (Automatic Reference Counting
- Error Handling and Result Type - Using do-try-catch blocks, custom errors
- Value types vs References - A simple example of when to use structs vs classes

<!--
- 📝 **Combine Basics** - Practical examples of reactive programming with Combine
~~- 📝 **Unit Testing** - Test-driven development with protocol-based mocks~~
~~- 📝 **REST API Integration** - Network layer implementation with mock responses~~
~~📝 **UIKit & Foundation** - Essential framework usage and patterns~~
~~📝 **SOLID Principles** - Practical application of software design principles~~
~~📝 **TCA & Reactive Programming** - The Composable Architecture and reactive patterns~~

## ⚠️ Known limitations

- These projects are designed for **demos** rather than production use
- Swift Playgrounds have certain limitations:
  - Persistent storage operations may be restricted
  - Complex UI interactions with Core Data have playground-specific constraints
- Each project tries to focuses on clarity of concept rather than production-ready implementation

## 🔍 How to Use

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the desired `.playground` file in Xcode
3. Run the playground to see the implementation and results
4. Explore the code comments for detailed explanations of concepts and techniques
