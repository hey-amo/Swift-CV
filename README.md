# Swift.CV - iOS development Portfolio

> **Swift & SwiftUI demos for employers, recruiters**

## üéØ Purpose

A collection of standalone demos in Swift showcasing practical iOS development skills.

Each project demonstrates specific technical competencies through code examples, documentation.

> Target Audience: Hiring managers, technical leads, and recruiters looking for junior iOS development talent.

## Core Swift Proficiency

- Functional Programming - map, filter, reduce, sorted operations
- Protocol-Oriented Programming - practical protocol implementations
- Error Handling - comprehensive error management patterns
- Value vs Reference Types - memory management understanding
- Concurrency - simple, modern async/await with traditional queue management

## iOS Development Patterns

- Core Data Integration - data persistence and relationship management
- Reactive Programming - Combine framework implementation
<!-- Architecture Patterns - MVVM, TCA, and dependency injection -->
- Asynchronous programming - structured concurrency with simple demo of async/await

## üìÇ Portfolio

### Demos

| Demo | Technical Focus | Business Value |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| **[FilterMapReduceSort](./Projects/FilterMapReduceSort.playground)** | Functional programming with semi-complex data | Efficient fast, data processing for small, user-facing features |
| **[ProtocolExamples](./Projects/ProtocolExamples.playground)** | Protocol-oriented design | Scalable demos |
| **[SimpleConcurrency](./Projects/SimpleConcurrency.playground)** | Queue management & threading and processing |
| **[ErrorHandlingDemo](./Projects/ErrorHandlingDemo.playground)** | Robust error management | Error handling for production apps |
| **[ValueVSRefDemo](./Projects/ValueVSRefDemo.playground)** | Memory management principles | Performance optimization and bug prevention |

---

### üöß In Progress

- **AsyncAwaitDemo** - Modern concurrency patterns with structured async/await
- **CoreDataBasics** - Local data persistence with entity relationships

### üìã **Planned**

- **CombineInPractice** - Reactive programming with publishers and subscribers  
- **TCABasics** - The Composable Architecture pattern implementation
- **DependencyInjection** - Clean architecture with inversion of control

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known limitations

- These projects are designed as **demos**, rather than production use.
- Some best practices may not be followed exactly.
- They might seem a bit rudimentary to outside observers.
- Swift Playgrounds have certain limitations:
- Persistent storage may be restricted, or are not functional.
- Complex UI interactions with Core Data have playground-specific constraints.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Quick Review
1. Browse the **Technical Skills Demonstrated** section above
2. Open any completed demo in Xcode Playgrounds
3. Review code and, where given, comments explaining implementation

### Deep Dive
1. Clone repository: `git clone [your-repo-url]`
2. Open `Projects/` folder in Xcode
3. Run each swift playground to see live examples
4. Where available, supporting documentation is available in project root

## üìû Contact & Next Steps

**I am actively looking for new iOS development opportunities** - junior to mid-level positions in startups, agencies, or established tech teams. Ideally, in the UK.

**Technical Interview Ready:** Can walk through any code example and explain implementation decisions, trade-offs, and potential improvements.
