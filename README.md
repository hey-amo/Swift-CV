# Swift.cv

## üéØ Purpose

These are *standalone* demos to showcase my general understanding of core Swift/iOS development concepts for job roles.

---

## Why does this exist?

I really wanted a way to showcase my learning, understanding of Swift in 1 repo; with core examples of standalone Swift projects for job role applications.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known limitations

- These projects are designed as **demos**, rather than production use.
- Some best practices may not be followed exactly.
- They might seem a bit rudimentary to outside observers.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Technical limitations

- Swift Playgrounds have certain limitations:
- Persistent storage might be restricted, or don't work correctly.
- Complex UI interactions with Core Data have playground-specific constraints

## üîç How to Use

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the desired `.playground` file in Xcode
3. Run the playground to see the implementation and results
4. Explore the code comments for detailed explanations of concepts and techniques
