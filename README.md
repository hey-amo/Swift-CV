# Sample Swifts

## Goal

Use standalone swift playground projects to showcase general understanding of Swift.

## Limitations

- Persistent storage (like saving to disk) may not work well or be practical in Playgrounds.
- UI-based features (e.g., SwiftUI + Core Data) are limited.

## Playground apps

- `Core data example`: Perform CRUD and search operations with Core data.
