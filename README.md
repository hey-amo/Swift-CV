# Swift.cv

## üéØ Purpose

A collection of standalone demos in Swift on Github for prospective employers, recruiters, start-ups that might be hiring.

---

## Why does this exist?

With the help of AI tools, I'm coaching myself to relearn core concepts of Swift; and to create simple demo examples.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known limitations

- These projects are designed as **demos**, rather than production use.
- Some best practices may not be followed exactly.
- They might seem a bit rudimentary to outside observers.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Technical limitations

- Swift Playgrounds have certain limitations:
- Persistent storage might be restricted, or don't work correctly.
- Complex UI interactions with Core Data have playground-specific constraints

## üîç How to Use

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the desired `.playground` file in Xcode
3. Run the playground to see the implementation and results
4. Explore the code comments for detailed explanations of concepts and techniques
