### 🚧 In Progress



### 📋 **Planned**

- **CombineInPractice** - Reactive programming with publishers and subscribers  
- **TCABasics** - The Composable Architecture pattern implementation
- **DependencyInjection** - Clean architecture with inversion of control
- **AsyncAwaitDemo** - Modern concurrency patterns with structured async/await

### ⚠️ Known limitations

- These projects are designed as **demos**, rather than production use.
- Some best practices may not be followed exactly.
- They might seem a bit rudimentary to outside observers.
- Swift Playgrounds have certain limitations:
- Persistent storage may be restricted, or are not functional.
- Complex UI interactions with Core Data have playground-specific constraints.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Review
1. Browse the **Technical Skills Demonstrated** section above
2. Open any completed demo in Xcode Playgrounds
3. Review code and, where given, comments explaining implementation

### Deep Dive
1. Clone repository: `git clone [your-repo-url]`
2. Open `Projects/` folder in Xcode
3. Run each swift playground to see live examples
4. Where available, supporting documentation is available in project root

## 📞 Contact & Next Steps

**I am actively looking for new iOS development opportunities** - junior to mid-level positions in startups, agencies, or established tech teams. Ideally, in the UK.

**Technical Interview Ready:** Can walk through any code example and explain implementation decisions and potential improvements.
