# Swift-CV

A curated set of Swift Playground projects demonstrating iOS development skills for common job iOS requirements.

## Goals

- Use standalone swift playground to showcase core Swift/iOS development concepts
- Highlight understanding of concurrency, Core Data, Combine, and basic SwiftUI architecture

## Known Limitations

- Persistent storage (like saving to disk) may not work well, or be practical in Playgrounds.
- UI-based features (e.g., SwiftUI + Core Data) are limited in playground environment
- Some samples may seem rudimentary to outside observers
- Projects are designed for **demonstration**, not production

## üìÅ Portfolio

- `FilterMapReduceSort` - Examples of functional coding on mock data with multiple relationships ‚úÖ
- `CoreDataCompany` - Basic Core Data modeling and queries - *In progress*
- ~~Swift concurrency models (GCD + async/await)~~ - *To be done*
- ~~Protocols~~ - *To be done*
<!--
- ~~SwiftUI with MVVM~~ - *To be done*
- ~~Combine Basics~~ - *To be done*
- ~~Unit testing with mocks and protocols~~ - *To be done*
- ~~REST with mock data~~ - *To be done*
- ~~UIKit, Foundation~~ - *To be done*
- ~~SOLID principles~~ - *To be done*
- ~~TCA, and reactive programming~~ *To be done* -->

<!--
| Project | Skills | Description |

| `CoreDataCompany.playground` | Core Data, Entity Relationships, CRUD, NSPredicate | Demonstrates semi-complex one-to-many and many-to-one Core Data relationships, including search and filtering. |
| `EnumDrivenState.playground` | Enums, State Management, Pattern Matching | Illustrates using enums to manage app state, a common approach in SwiftUI and MVVM projects. |
| `AsyncConcurrency.playground` | GCD, async/await, MainActor | Realistic examples of data fetching and updating using both legacy concurrency and Swift‚Äôs structured concurrency. |
| `CombineBasics.playground` | Combine, Publishers, Reactive Programming | Demonstrates basic Combine, `PassthroughSubject`, debouncing, filtering, and more. |
| `MVVMMock.playground` | SwiftUI, MVVM, Dependency Injection | Mini demo with testable ViewModels and MVVM separation of concerns using SwiftUI. |
| `UnitTestingSwift.playground` | XCTest, Mocks, Dependency Injection | Contains unit test examples for services and view models, showing dependency injection and mocking with protocols. |
| `Protocols.playground` | Protocols |Examples of basic and advanced protocol programming.|
