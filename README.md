# Swift.cv

## üéØ Purpose

These are *standalone* demos to showcase my general understanding of core Swift/iOS development concepts for job roles.

---

## Why does this exist?

I really wanted a way to showcase my learning, understanding of Swift in 1 repo; with core examples of standalone Swift projects for job role applications.

## üìÇ Portfolio

### ‚úÖ Completed

List of demos

| Project | Skills | Description |
|------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| **FilterMapReduceSort** | Filter, Map, Reduce, Sort | Demonstrates functional programming techniques with semi-complex relational data |
| **ProtocolExamples** | Protocols |  Showcases 4 practical implementations of protocols |
| **SimpleConcurrency** | Dispatch, completionBlocks | Simple Concurrency demos with dispatch, serial and concurrent queues |
| **ErrorHandlingDemo** | Do-try-catch, custom errors, custom error messages | Error Handling and Result Type - Using do-try-catch blocks and custom errors |

---

### üìù In Progress

- **CoreDataDemo** - Core Data, Entity Relationships, CRUD, NSPredicate, Demonstrates semi-complex one-to-many and many-to-one Core Data relationships, including search and filtering.
- ValueVSRefDemo - A simple example of when to use structs vs classes

---

### üìù Planned

- MemoryMgtDemo -  Simple Memory Management and ARC (Automatic Reference Counting)
- Modern async/await implementation 
- Task management with cancellation handling
- Memory Management and ARC (Automatic Reference Counting)
- Combine Basics- Simple examples of using reactive programming with Combine
- Simple MVVM example - Show MVVM pattern, separation of concerns
- TCA, reactive programming - The Composable Architecture and reactive patterns

<!--
~~- **Unit Testing** - XCTest, Mocks, Dependency Injection | Contains unit test examples for services and view models, showing dependency injection and mocking with protocols.~~
~~- **REST API Integration** - Network layer implementation with mock responses~~
~~ **UIKit & Foundation** - Essential framework usage and patterns~~
~~ **SOLID Principles** - Practical application of software design principles~~
~~ **TCA & Reactive Programming** - The Composable Architecture and reactive patterns~~
| `EnumDrivenState.playground` | Enums, State Management, Pattern Matching | Illustrates using enums to manage app state, a common approach in SwiftUI and MVVM projects. |
| `AsyncConcurrency.playground` | GCD, async/await, MainActor | Realistic examples of data fetching and updating using both legacy concurrency and Swift‚Äôs structured concurrency. |

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known limitations

- These projects are designed as **demos**, rather than production use.
- Some best practices may not be followed exactly.
- They might seem a bit rudimentary to outside observers.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Technical limitations

- Swift Playgrounds have certain limitations:
- Persistent storage might be restricted, or don't work correctly.
- Complex UI interactions with Core Data have playground-specific constraints

## üîç How to Use

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the desired `.playground` file in Xcode
3. Run the playground to see the implementation and results
4. Explore the code comments for detailed explanations of concepts and techniques
