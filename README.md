# Swift.CV - iOS development Portfolio

I am a junior iOS developer looking for work as a Swift iOS developer.

This is a portfolio of Swift demos for those who might be hiring.

## üéØ Purpose

This is a curation of standalone demos in Swift showcasing practical iOS development skills.

Target Audience: Hiring managers, technical leads, and recruiters looking for **junior** iOS development talent.

### üöß In Progress


### üìã **Planned**

- **CombineInPractice** - Reactive programming with publishers and subscribers  
- **TCABasics** - The Composable Architecture pattern implementation
- **DependencyInjection** - Clean architecture with inversion of control
- **AsyncAwaitDemo** - Modern concurrency patterns with structured async/await

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known limitations

- These projects are designed as **demos**, rather than production use.
- Some best practices may not be followed exactly.
- They might seem a bit rudimentary to outside observers.
- Swift Playgrounds have certain limitations:
- Persistent storage may be restricted, or are not functional.
- Complex UI interactions with Core Data have playground-specific constraints.
- SwiftData has minimum OS requirements
- Swift6 enforces a more  stricter concurrency checking, where possible, this is avoided for demos

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Quick Review
1. Browse the **Technical Skills Demonstrated** section above
2. Open any completed demo in Xcode Playgrounds
3. Review code and, where given, comments explaining implementation

### Deep Dive
1. Clone repository: `git clone [your-repo-url]`
2. Open `Projects/` folder in Xcode
3. Run each swift playground to see live examples
4. Where available, supporting documentation is available in project root

## üìû Contact & Next Steps

**I am actively looking for new iOS development opportunities** - junior to mid-level positions in startups, agencies, or established tech teams. Ideally, in the UK.

**Technical Interview Ready:** Can walk through any code example and explain implementation decisions and potential improvements.
