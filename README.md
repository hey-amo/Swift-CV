@author: github.com/heyamo/


## üéØ Purpose

These are *standalone* swift playground to showcase my general understanding of core Swift/iOS development concepts for job roles.

---

## Why does this exist?

I really wanted a way to showcase my learning, understanding of Swift in 1 repo; with core examples of standalone Swift projects for job role applications.

---

## üìÇ Portfolio

### ‚úÖ Completed

- **FilterMapReduceSort** - Demonstrates functional programming techniques with semi-complex relational data 

- **ProtocolExamples** - Showcases 4 practical implementations of protocols, from basic to advanced usage

- **SimpleConcurrency** -  Simple Concurrency demos with dispatch, serial and concurrent queues (GCD)

- **ErrorHandlingDemo** - Error Handling and Result Type - Using do-try-catch blocks, custom errors


| Project | Skills | Description |
|------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| `CoreDataCompany.playground` | Core Data, Entity Relationships, CRUD, NSPredicate | Demonstrates semi-complex one-to-many and many-to-one Core Data relationships, including search and filtering. |


---

### üìù In Progress

- **CoreDataCompany** - Core Data modelling and query implementation with relationship handling


### üìù Planned
- Memory Management and ARC (Automatic Reference Counting
- Value types vs References - A simple example of when to use structs vs classes
- Combine Basics- Simple examples of using reactive programming with Combine

<!--
~~- üìù **Unit Testing** - Test-driven development with protocol-based mocks~~
~~- üìù **REST API Integration** - Network layer implementation with mock responses~~
~~üìù **UIKit & Foundation** - Essential framework usage and patterns~~
~~üìù **SOLID Principles** - Practical application of software design principles~~
~~üìù **TCA & Reactive Programming** - The Composable Architecture and reactive patterns~~

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known limitations

- These projects are designed as **demos**, rather than production use
- I am not an expert Swift developer; so some best practices may not be followed exactly
- They might seem a bit rudimentary to outside observers.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Technical limitations

- Swift Playgrounds have certain limitations:
- Persistent storage might be restricted, or don't work correctly.
- Complex UI interactions with Core Data have playground-specific constraints

## üîç How to Use

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the desired `.playground` file in Xcode
3. Run the playground to see the implementation and results
4. Explore the code comments for detailed explanations of concepts and techniques
