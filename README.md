# Swift-CV

This contains a collection of Swift playgrounds aims to demonstrate my capabilities as a modern Swift iOS developer. Each playground is focused, annotated, and explains key concepts relevant to real-world job requirements.

## üìå Goals

- Use standalone swift playground to showcase core Swift/iOS development concepts
- Highlight understanding of concurrency, Core Data, Combine, and basic SwiftUI architecture

## Known Limitations

- Persistent storage (like saving to disk) may not work well, or be practical in Playgrounds.
- UI-based features (e.g., SwiftUI + Core Data) are limited in playground environment
- Some samples may seem rudimentary to outside observers
- Projects are designed for demonstration, not production

## üìÅ Portfolio

This file outlines each Swift playground project included in this repository, categorized by core development skills relevant to iOS roles.

| ‚úÖ Project Title | üöÄ Skills Demonstrated | üí¨ Description |
|------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| `CoreDataCompany.playground` | Core Data, Entity Relationships, CRUD, NSPredicate | Demonstrates semi-complex one-to-many and many-to-one Core Data relationships, including search and filtering. |
| `EnumDrivenState.playground` | Enums, State Management, Pattern Matching | Illustrates using enums to manage app state, a common approach in SwiftUI and MVVM projects. |
| `AsyncConcurrency.playground` | GCD, async/await, MainActor | Realistic examples of data fetching and updating using both legacy concurrency and Swift‚Äôs structured concurrency. |
| `CombineBasics.playground` | Combine, Publishers, Reactive Programming | Demonstrates creating Combine pipelines using `Just`, `PassthroughSubject`, debouncing, filtering, and more. |
| `MVVMMockApp.playground` | SwiftUI, MVVM, Dependency Injection | Mini architecture demo with testable ViewModels and proper separation of concerns using SwiftUI. |
| `UnitTestingSwift.playground` | XCTest, Mocks, Dependency Injection | Contains unit test examples for services and view models, showing dependency injection and mocking with protocols. |
