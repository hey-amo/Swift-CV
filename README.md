# Swift.cv

A curation of demos showcasing common Swift programming concepts to demonstrate my iOS development understanding.

---

## üéØ Purpose

These are *standalone* swift playground to showcase core Swift/iOS development concepts.

---

## üìÇ Portfolio

### ‚úÖ Completed
- **FilterMapReduceSort** - Demonstrates functional programming techniques with complex relational data 
- **ProtocolExamples** - Showcases 4 practical implementations of protocols, from basic to advanced usage

---

### üìù In Progress
- **Simple Swift Concurrency** - Demonstrations of GCD and modern async/await patterns
- **CoreDataCompany** - Core Data modelling and query implementation with relationship handling

### üìù Planned
- Memory Management and ARC (Automatic Reference Counting
- Error Handling and Result Type - Using do-try-catch blocks, custom errors
- Value types vs References - A simple example of when to use structs vs classes
- Combine Basics- Simple examples of using reactive programming with Combine

<!--
~~- üìù **Unit Testing** - Test-driven development with protocol-based mocks~~
~~- üìù **REST API Integration** - Network layer implementation with mock responses~~
~~üìù **UIKit & Foundation** - Essential framework usage and patterns~~
~~üìù **SOLID Principles** - Practical application of software design principles~~
~~üìù **TCA & Reactive Programming** - The Composable Architecture and reactive patterns~~

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known limitations

- These projects are designed for **demos** rather than production use
- I am not an expert Swift developer; so some best practices may not be followed exactly
- They might seem a bit rudimentary
- Each project tries to focuses on concepts, rather than production-ready implementation.

### Technical limitations

- Swift Playgrounds have certain limitations:
- Persistent storage might be restricted, or don't work correctly.
- Complex UI interactions with Core Data have playground-specific constraints

## üîç How to Use

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the desired `.playground` file in Xcode
3. Run the playground to see the implementation and results
4. Explore the code comments for detailed explanations of concepts and techniques
